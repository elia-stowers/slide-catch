# slide-catch
**Project**: 
I wanted to make this game show my character and some of my interests. 
The goal of this game is to feed Diesel as many apples as possible. There are some apples with worms in them, and you have to dodge those ones. 
As the player, you are Diesel. It is very important to keep an eye out for the bad apples and avoid collision with them. Horses should not eat apples with worms in them! 


**Technologies**: 
1. Python: The programming language used to develop the game.
2. Pygame: A Python library for creating video games. It provides functionality for graphics, sound, and user input.
3. Simple GE: A simple game engine built on top of Pygame. It simplifies game development by providing higher-level abstractions for game objects and game loop management.


**Techniques**: 
1. Object-Oriented Program: The game is structured using classes and objects. Each game element, such as the player, obstacles, and horse, is represented by a class.
2. Game Loop: The game loop is used to continuously update the game state and render the graphics.
3. Collision detection: The game checks for collisions between the player and obstacles to determine if the game should end.
4. Random Generation: Random numbers are used to spawn obstacles at random positions and intervals.
5. Score Tracking: The game tracks the player's score.

Description of my process: 
1. I have learned that this class is very hard and complex. There are so many little errors and very tedious corrections.
2. I am definitely struggling with how to create the game to want to collect the good apples, but dodge the bad ones.
3. I used the same submission for slide and catch, but corrected some things and added a bad apple to try to dodge. I am at a loss on how to make it work.
4. I would like to improve this game by adding power ups and such.
5. Next time, I think it would be cool if I could put pictures of all of my horses and the player can "choose a character".
6. I stayed with my game design document, just added a few more things. (well, I tried to add but I wasnt very successful).
7. It is actually ironic to say this because of the theme of my project, but I stayed on track by telling myself I can't ride Diesel unitl this project is complete. This has been hard for me because usually I am traveling to horse races all summer, but I have a very busy schedule this summer, and have not been able to go to any rodeos.
